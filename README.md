Exercise 3:  
The javascript file has 3 functions:  
1. validatePassword checks if 2 strings match, these should have at least 8 characters, 1 uppercase character, and 1 lowercase character.  
2. reversePassword reverses the string.  
3. storePassword returns an object that contains the name and the newpassword as keys. If the passwords are valid using validatePassword, newpassword = reversed string. If not, then the value of newpassword = first given string.
